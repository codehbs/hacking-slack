# Hacking Slack
Learn how to hack your section's Slack. Who gives out the most hearts in your section's Slack? Who makes the best Memes? We are in business school and we use data. [Jesse](https://github.com/jorshman) will show us how he hacked Slack (legally, through an API) and pull out interesting statistics from their section's group chat. Armed with Ruby, SQL and some Regex magic, we may go into the details during Hour of Code so you can also do this at home! 

It's a slippery slope after that... Remember those reckless jokes you made about your FRC professors? Yes, they are coming back to haunt you.

## Build your app
